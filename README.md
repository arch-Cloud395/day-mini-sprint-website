Mini Sprint Delivery (Jira + GitHub Pages)

This repository documents a five-day mini sprint executed using Jira Scrum to deliver a small but real improvement to a website. The focus of the assignment was not the size of the change, but the end-to-end delivery process: sprint setup, story tracking, daily Scrum updates, incremental improvements, and live deployment.

The feature implemented was a footer displaying the website version, deploy date, and author. All changes were built locally, versioned with Git, and deployed successfully to GitHub Pages, with each step tracked and evidenced in Jira through subtasks, comments, and burndown charts.

This project demonstrates practical Agile and DevOps behaviors such as incremental delivery, traceability, and verification on a live environment, rather than isolated or theoretical development.
